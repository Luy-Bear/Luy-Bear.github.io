          Hello there, I am Pedro Rodrigues and am a recent software engineer graduate.
          This is my new website ... Its a work in progress! I am in the 
          process of self teaching HTML/CSS/JS/REACT. Due
          to this my website might look a little blank for some time. 
          Bare with me, it will look much better soon!  
      </p>
